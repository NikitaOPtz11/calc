# C++ Calculator
A very simple calculator created in C++ to compute basic operations on numbers.

## How to use?
Save the `Calculator.h` header file to your computer and implement it just as demonestrated in the `test.cpp` file, then run `test.cpp` using any compiler.

## Prerequisites
GNU++ 2011 or higher.

## Note 
The calculator currently shared doesn't support **precedence of mathematical operators**, so providing operations like `1 + 2 * 3` would make it compute the addition of 1 and 2 first and then do the multiplication. It's still _underdeveloped_.
